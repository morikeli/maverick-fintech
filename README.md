Maverick was born out of a challenge to design and build a user-centered fintech app using Flutter. The task was to create a functional mobile banking prototype for a chosen target audience, focusing on:
  - 📱 Mobile-first product design with strong UX.
  - 🛠 Modular, maintainable Flutter architecture with clear separation of concerns.
  - ⚡ Smooth state management, local storage, and routing.
  - 🤝 Real-world problem-solving for underserved markets, especially in Africa.

This wasn’t just a coding challenge — it was an exercise in product thinking, aligning technical execution with genuine user needs while balancing feasibility, scalability, and user experience.
